Hi this is pretty simple to set up.

firstly, the only API key that you need is OpenAI's, which is pretty cheap and lasts quite a while.

Elevenlabs API is good for using those crispy high quality TTS voices, but tbh it runs out pretty fast.

You will also need a Twitch Oauth token in order to actually connect to twitch chats, and the account you use to create the token should be the same account that you're connected to, ie your own account.

You can get an oauth token at https://twitchtokengenerator.com/ where you need to select Bot Chat Token, click "yes" for "chat:read" and then "generate token" at the bottom, at which point you'll see "Access Token" at the top. Copy it, and paste it, ensuring that you have "oauth:" before it (example - oauth:EJK34j34)

After that, it's literally a matter of just setting up the bot's personality and all the information in the setup tab, and testing it.

There are 2 default png's for the bot to use while idle and speaking, but you should obviously replace them with your own, and adjust the sensitivity slider to make sure it looks good while talking.

Other than that have fun good luck i'm online all the time if you have questions weee yippeeee
